ðŸ”§ Features:
- Add a new note with a timestamp
- View all saved notes
- Search notes by keyword
- Delete specific notes
- All notes stored in a .txt file using open(), read(), write(), and with statements
ðŸ’¡ Why itâ€™s useful:
It's a great beginner project to practice file I/O, string manipulation, and control flow in Python. Plus, it's easily expandableâ€”think tags, encryption, or even syncing to the cloud.
